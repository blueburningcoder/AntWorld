# AntWorld
An Environment for several AI's, searching for food and other resources.
Nearly all the variables can be changed by the user.


Project done with Clion, Code::Blocks and Sublime Text, written in C++

Used librarys: SFML, TinyXML2, TGUI (GUI for SFML)




To build the project for yourself: open the AntWorld.cbp file with code::blocks.

Should work with clion too since all the necessary information (like the cmake files) are included, but it's not able to load the image due to different build structure (my guess).





Further details are added soon
